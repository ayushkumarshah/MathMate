# MathMate

#### 3rd semester Project

###### Abstract

Our project entitled ‘MathMate’ is an interactive program that aims to provide solution of mathematical equations, problems and various unit conversions. This program was developed especially by undergraduate students.  This program is written using Android SDK .

We, with our project, aim to ease the calculations of different types of equations, numerical computational methods, differential problems, etc upon students. As this is our first project we aim to keep it simple yet useful. With this application people can always have a smart calculator on their hands. The calculator can be used by students and teachers for different mathematical problems. This application also shows the use of numerical computational methods like Bisection method, Newton Raphson method to find the root of any polynomial equations.

One of the features that is different from other similar available calculator applications is that our application shows the detailed process and steps involved in different operations like solving linear equations, quadratic equations, bisection method, etc. This is a unique feature that we have introduced in our application which makes it easier for the students to view the process involved and check exactly where they have made mistake easily if the answers don’t match. Our application also uses HCI for better human interaction with the app. We have also used database for our application to store the results of calculations as history.

As a result, we got knowledge on use of different languages like JAVA, SQLite, XML, Android, etc during the application learning and development phase. We also got to know about using database to store information and also learnt how to develop applications for the welfare of people and work efficiently to make the application as user friendly as possible.
